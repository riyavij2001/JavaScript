# Snake Water Gun Game in Python

This project is a simple Snake Water Gun game implemented in Python. The game is played between a player and the computer. The player chooses an option (snake, water, or gun), and the computer randomly selects its option. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Rules

-   Snake beats Water: If the player chooses Snake and the computer chooses Water, the player wins.
- Water beats Gun: If the player chooses Water and the computer chooses Gun, the player wins.
- Gun beats Snake: If the player chooses Gun and the computer chooses Snake, the player wins.
- If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie.


## Technologies Used
