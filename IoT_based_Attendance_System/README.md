# IoT-based Attendance System Using RFID and Raspberry Pi

The IoT-based Attendance System using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and Raspberry Pi is a project that aims to automate attendance management in various settings, such as schools, offices, or events. The system utilizes RFID technology to track and record attendance information in real-time, providing an efficient and accurate alternative to manual attendance tracking.

This README file serves as a guide to help you understand the project and its components, as well as provide instructions for setting up and using the system effectively.

## Features

-   RFID Technology: The system employs RFID tags and readers to identify and authenticate individuals.

-   Real-time Tracking: Attendance data is captured and recorded in real-time, allowing instant monitoring and reporting.

-   Automated Notifications: Automatic notifications can be set up to inform administrators, parents, or individuals about attendance-related events or updates.

-   Data Security: The attendance data is securely stored and can be accessed only by authorized personnel.

## Hardware Requirements

To set up the IoT-based Attendance System, you will need the following hardware components:

-   Raspberry Pi (preferably model 3 or above)
-   RFID Reader and RFID tags
-   Ethernet or Wi-Fi module for Raspberry Pi
-   Power supply for Raspberry Pi
-   Internet connection

Please ensure you have all the necessary hardware components before proceeding with the setup.

## Software Requirements

The software requirements for the IoT-based Attendance System are as follows:

-   Raspbian OS (or any compatible Linux distribution) installed on Raspberry Pi
-   Python programming language (version 3.0 or above)
-   Required Python libraries

Make sure you have the latest versions of the required software components installed before proceeding.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to install and set up the IoT-based Attendance System:

1. Connect the RFID reader to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate interface (e.g., SPI, UART, etc.) and make sure it is properly powered.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet using either an Ethernet cable or a Wi-Fi module (only required for initial setup and updates).
3. Install the required software libraries on the Raspberry Pi. You can use package managers like pip or apt-get to install the necessary Python libraries.

4. Clone or download the project's source code from the repository to your Raspberry Pi.

5. Configure the system by modifying the necessary parameters in the configuration file (e.g., database connection details, RFID reader settings, etc.).

6. Set up the database by executing the provided SQL scripts or using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like SQLAlchemy.

7. Start the system by running the main Python script. This script will initialize the RFID reader and other components.

8. Interact with the system through the command line interface (CLI) on the Raspberry Pi itself.

## Usage

Once the IoT-based Attendance System is set up and running, you can perform the following actions:

-   Register individuals: Add individuals to the system by assigning them unique RFID tags and entering their details through the web interface.

-   Capture attendance: When an individual scans their RFID tag using the RFID reader, the system records their attendance in real-time.

-   Manage attendance records: Use the web interface to view, edit, or delete attendance records. Generate reports for specific time periods or individuals as needed.

-   Configure notifications: Set up automatic notifications to inform administrators, parents, or individuals about attendance-related events or updates.
    Refer to the project's documentation or source code comments for detailed information on how to use each feature effectively.
